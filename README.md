# Open Lighting Architecture Logo

Here’s a high-quality copy of the OLA logo, based on the original by Simon Newton (seen in `development/old`).

The font Century Gothic was chosen as it’s simple, and it has a circular O character we can use to represent a 5-pin XLR connector. Kerning was modified so the characters sit nicer together. The terminal at the bottom of the L has been customised to fit better alongside the A.

## Repository Structure

It was created in Adobe Illustrator CS6. The `vector` directory contains versions in `.ai` for Illustrator CS3, `.pdf`, `.eps`, and `.svg`. There’s some in both RGB and CMYK colour.

The `bitmap` directory simply contains a large transparent `.png`, but more bitmap images can easily be created if needed from the vector source.

For use on the OLA web interface, there’s specific versions in the `web fitted` directory. These are created in Photoshop, so the paths can be aligned to exact pixels.
